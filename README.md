# Form Validation Web Development Project

## Overview

This project involves the creation and testing of form validation for a basic details registration form. The form collects essential information from users such as their first name, last name, email ID, user ID, country, state, city, phone number, and reference code. The goal is to ensure that user inputs are properly validated before submitting the form.

## Files Included

The project includes the following files:

- `index.html`: This HTML file contains the structure of the registration form along with the necessary input fields and buttons.
- `registration.css`: This CSS file provides styling for the form and its elements to enhance the user experience.
- `registration.js`: This JavaScript file implements form validation logic. It ensures that user inputs are properly filled and meet specific criteria before submitting the form.

## Features

- **Form Layout**: The form follows a two-column layout, providing a clean and organized appearance.
- **Field Validation**: JavaScript is used to validate various fields such as first name, last name, user ID, reference code, email ID, phone number, country, and city.
- **Styling**: CSS styling enhances the form's appearance and user interaction, including hover effects and focus states.

## How to Use

1. Open `registration.html` in a web browser to view the registration form.
2. Fill out the form fields with valid and invalid inputs to observe the validation in action.
3. Invalid inputs trigger error messages and styling changes.
4. Valid inputs allow the form to be successfully submitted, triggering a confirmation alert (uncomment the line in the JavaScript file to enable actual form submission).

## Authors

This project was collaboratively developed by Moses Chigwende and Kamohelo Mototo.

## Notes

- This project serves as a demonstration of form validation techniques using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- For real-world applications, additional validation, security measures, and backend processing would be necessary.

Feel free to explore the files and experiment with different inputs to understand how form validation is implemented in this project.

**Note:** Ensure that the provided code for form validation (JavaScript and CSS) is included in your repository or linked correctly in your HTML file for the validation to work properly.
